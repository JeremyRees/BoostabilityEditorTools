# Boostability Editor Tools

This is a Chrome extension I created to automate some of the more tedious bits of editing articles. It addresses pain points I've felt myself while working as an editor, primarily inserting links and review comments.

The code is published here on Github because the extension requires permission to inject a script into the editor dashboard webpage. Because granting this permission can be a security issue, the source is here available for review to ensure the extension isn't doing anything shady.

The extension is available for download [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/boostability-utilities/lfincjkefehemedlhalmhcpdcmienojo).

### Features

* Using the extension, the editor can assign an article rating, insert the appropriate review comment, and complete the task using just a keyboard shortcut and three keystrokes or less. (For approving articles only, not rejecting).
* One keyboard shortcut will instantly insert the client's link on the highlighted text.
* (*Coming soon*) For the Active Keywords link strategy type, the extension will automatically scan the article for the target keyword and, if found, insert the client's link.
* Play or pause the task timer with a keyboard shortcut.
* The user is allowed extensive customization of their controls.
